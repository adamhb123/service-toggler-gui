# Service Toggler GUI
Very simple (read: low-effort) GUI interface for the service application. Supports service {start, stop, restart}

Requires GTK3
## Usage
```
chmod +x ./service-toggler
./service-toggler
```
Note that your user must have appropriate permissions to run the above
commands. If you do not, you might be asked for credentials in the console, or it just won't work.
